Hello there, and thank you for downloading

SIMPLE PACKAGE INSTALLER

HOW TO USE
===================================================

Type in the name of the package (i.e. "ffmpeg"),
make sure it is spelled correctly, (everything is
case sensitive) and we will do the rest!
Note: When using this program, it is normal when 
you see a terminal appear (A.K.A. the scary, 
rapidly appearing text you see.)

===================================================

WHAT THIS IS
===================================================

This is simple and lightweight package installer 
intended for new Linux users who may find command
line tools daunting and unfamiliar, as well as 
regular Linux users who don't want to constantly 
type in terminal for a new package. This is NOT
for seasoned Linux veterans who are command line
warriors.

==================================================

DEPENDENCIES
==================================================

Python 3.0, possibly later if it doesn't work.
Tkinter, for the interface.
